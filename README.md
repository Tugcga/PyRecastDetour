# What is it

This is Python binary library for generating and using navigation mesh. Based on [RecastNavigation](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation) c++ library.

Feature:
* Generate navmesh from *.obj file and also from raw vertices and polygons data
* Save and load navmesh to (and from) binary file
* Generate triangulation of the navmesh for using in external applications
* Find the shortest path between two input points and the shortest distance to the navmesh wall from the input point
